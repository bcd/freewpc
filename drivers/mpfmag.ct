/*
 * Driver for TZ mini-playfield magnets
 * (derived from spsol.ct)
 *
 * The parameters are:
 * sw - the switch number that triggers it
 * sol - the solenoid/coil that gets fired automatically
 * ontime - how long the coil is kept on
 * offtime - how long the coil is kept off after it was fired, before
 * 	polling the switch again.  This prevents constant lock-on.
