This directory contains machine-specific files.  Each supported
game should put its files into its own subdirectory.

At a minimum, each machine must provide a Makefile and a machine
description file (same basename as the directory, with suffix .md).

For WPC, the top of the .md should define the generation of
machine used.  Here are the values to use and the games that they
apply to.  Games with "+" already have at least a basic machine description.
