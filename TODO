The following list of work items was generated by grepping for "TODO"
through the code, then sorted according to feature and priority.

Poor Design
* Remove gendefines???
* Rename 'idle' to 'periodic'
* Teach gencallset to ignore code that isn't being compiled in.
* Move printf and game state machine code out of the system page.


Missing Feature
* Abort after so many ball searches, or try another method (chase ball?)
* Coin Door Ballsave
* Lamp strobing, like newer Sterns
* Flasher allocation for lamp effects
* Add lock magnet/Magna-Goalie/goalie driver
* Sound effects cannot alter volume temporarily: started


Bugs
* TZ clock decoding is not perfect.
* When changing adjustments, 'confirmation' screen does not work.
* Factory defaults should be different per country code.
* Switch levels/edges tests do not work.  In Progress.
* DCS sound bringup does not work well


Compiler Changes
* Multiply by 16 should not be unrolled to shift; mul works best.
* sprintf() jump table per character is way too large.
* Non-variadic arguments in a variadic function are OK to place in
registers.


Nice to Have
* ./include/freewpc.h:/* TODO - move these elsewhere */
* ./include/freewpc.h:/* Uncommon software modules - TODO : shouldn't automatically include */
* ./include/printf.h:/* TODO : much of this is implementing a 'varargs' type facility.
* Score sweeping for player up : in progress, see 'score_deff' branch
* ./kernel/font.c:		/* TODO - use a real strcpy() here that is more efficient */
